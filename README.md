This project, conducted as part of a Causal Inference Capstone class at Macalester College, investigates the impact of home field advantage in Major League Baseball (MLB) by quantifying how playing at home affects a team's win percentage. Using data from Retrosheet and additional player and team statistics, we analyze the "treatment" of playing at home through methods like partial exact matching. Our findings reveal that certain teams, such as Colorado, Toronto, and the New York Yankees, benefit significantly from home field advantage, while others, like the Cubs, show no significant effect. We also explore the role of confounding variables and conduct sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of our results. The full analysis, including visualizations and code, can be found in the project files linked in the repository.
