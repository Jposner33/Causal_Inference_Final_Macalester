Our project, titled The Reality of Home Field Advantage, explores the effect of playing at home on team performance in Major League Baseball (MLB). Using data from Retrosheet and Baseball Reference, the analysis quantifies the impact of home field advantage on winning percentages, focusing on factors such as stadium characteristics, fan support, and team dynamics. The study applies statistical methods including partial exact matching and causal models to assess how home field advantage varies across teams and seasons. Results reveal that while home field advantage is significant for many teams, its impact is not uniform across the league, highlighting the complex factors that contribute to a team's performance. This project was created by Macalester statistics students in a Causal Inference Capstone class in 2024.
